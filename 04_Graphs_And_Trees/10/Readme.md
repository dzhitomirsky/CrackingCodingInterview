Check Subtree: T l and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T l much bigger than T2. 
Create an
algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of Tl.
A tree T2 is a subtree ofT i if there exists a node n in T i such that the subtree of n is 
identical to T2.
That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
